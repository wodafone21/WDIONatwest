# SDET code test

Create an end to end (e2e) test that comprises the following steps: 
1.	Navigate to `https://www.saucedemo.com/`
2.  Log in using the `standard_user` account, password for all accounts is listed on the page
2.	Sort the products by `Price (high to low)`
3.	Add the cheapest & most expensive products to your basket
4.	Open the basket
5.	Checkout
6.	Enter mock user details
7.	Complete the purchase

What we are expecting: 
-  Using best practices write a test framework that can test the above user journey
-  We currently write out e2e tests using JavaScript/TypeScript with Cypress and Playwright but you are free to use whichever tool you are most comfortable with

To complete the test:
1.  Clone the repo
2.  Create a new branch, commit your solution and push
3.  Open a pull request so that we are able to review your changes, please add any documentation/notes about running your solution to the description in the pull request
